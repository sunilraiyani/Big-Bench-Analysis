Run "test.sh" from the folder "scripts" 

1.) Specify the data size in Gb (default is 1 Gb) for which you want to run the load in the line $BIG_BENCH_BASH_SCRIPT_DIR/bigBenchRun.sh "datasize"

2.)The response time will be stored in out[datasize]g.txt file


3.)The errors will be stored in err[datasize]g.txt file
